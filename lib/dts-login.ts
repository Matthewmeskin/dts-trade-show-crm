/**
 * One DTS sign-in. Every DTS portal shares one set of accounts (one Supabase
 * project), and the operations hub keeps the one login page:
 * - a signed-out visit here is sent to the hub's /sso/crm, which shows the
 *   shared login if needed and then hands the session back to /auth/sso;
 * - someone already signed in at the hub comes straight through, no second
 *   sign-in.
 * The CRM's own login form is still reachable at /login?local=1, and a
 * failed hand-off lands there, so a hub outage never locks anyone out.
